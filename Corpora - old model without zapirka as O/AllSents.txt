The initial [learning rate] was set to 0.0005, as shown in Table 1.
Deep Voice 3 is a fully [convolutional] architecture for speech synthesis.
Its character-to-spectrogram architecture enables fully parallel computation and the training is much faster than at the [RNN] architectures.
Those features are in a (key, value) form and they are fed into the [attention-based decoder].
The [hidden layers] of the [decoder] are fed into the third converter layer, which is capable of predicting the acoustic features for waveform synthesis.
The [training of the model] is followed by [validation], which means that each 10K [steps] are evaluated before the [training] process proceeds.
The evaluation is done on external, unknown sentences that provide insight into the advancement of the learnt dependencies between the dataset and the [hidden layer weights].
Deep Voice 3 suggested that [parameters] worked perfectly for our model, thus we used the same [hyperparameters] without increasing the demand due to our resource limitations.
The model started to produce an intelligible, understandable, and partially human-like speech after 50 K [steps], as observed from the figure.
[Loss function] is a metric that refers to the [accuracy] of the [prediction].
The main objective is to minimize the [model] errors or minimize the [loss function].
In our case, the [loss functions] behaves in a desired manner, it gradually decreases, [converging] to a value of 0.1731 after 162.2 K [steps] in four days and 11 h of [training].
[Learning rate] plays a vital role in minimizing the [loss function].
The [gradient norm] that is presented in the same figure calculates the [L2] norm of the [gradients] of the [last layer] of the [Deep learning network].
It is an indicator showing whether the [weights] of the [Deep learning network] are properly updated.
This problem affects the upper [layers] of the [Deep learning network], making it really hard for the network to learn and tune the [parameters].
In such case, the model is unstable and it is not able to learn from data, since the accumulation of large [error gradients] during the [training process] result in very large updates in the [Deep learning model weights].
By principles of [transfer learning] ,we tried to [fine-tune] the Russian [TTS model].
So as to automatically and accurately classify the FCGR encoded data, we experimentally compared [Multilayer Perceptron] [Artificial Neural Network] ([MLP-ANN]), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB), which are frontline pattern recognition tools in [machine learning].
The [MLP-ANN] contains 64 [neurons] in the [input layer] (64 element FCGR), 6 [neurons] in the [output layer] (5 mutation classes and 1 normal class) and two [hidden layers] with the [neurons] experimentally varied from 10 to 100.
The result obtained by varying the [neurons] in the [hidden layer] is reported in Sect 3.
[Deep neural networks] ([DNN]) or [deep learning models], were proved to be able to extract automatically useful features from input patterns.
Under this framework, [Long Short-Term Memory] ([LSTM]) is a [recurrent unit] that reads a sequence one step at a time and can exploit long range relations.
In this work, we propose a [DNN] model for nucleosome identification on sequences from three different species.
Recently [deep neural networks] or [deep learning models], were proved to be able to automatically extract useful features from input patterns with no a priori information.
The two main categories of [deep neural models] are [Convolutional Neural Networks] ([CNN]) and [Recurrent Neural Networks] ([RNN]).
[CNNs] are characterized by an [initial layer] of [convolutional filters], followed by a non Linearity, a sub-sampling, and a [fully connected layer] which realized the final classification.
Conversely, in this work we want to avoid the feature extraction step in order to fully exploit the capabilities of [DNNs], making use of a [convolutional layer] for extracting features from local sequences of nucleotides, and an [LSTM] to take into account longer-range positional information.
Another important component of a [deep neural network] is the [max-pooling] layer, that usually follows the recurrent or [convolutional layers] in the computation flow.
The [dropout layer] randomly sets to zero the output from the preceding layer during training, with a probability p given as a fixed parameter.
When p = 0.5, it is equivalent to training 2|W| networks with shared parameters, where |W| is the number of [neurons] subject to dropout.
This results in a strong [regularization] effect, which helps in preventing [overfitting].
We propose three kind of architectures, obtained by the composition of six kinds of [neural layers]: a [convolutional layer], a [max pooling layer], a [dropout layer], a [long short-term memory] ([LSTM]) layer, a [fully connected layer] and a [softmax] layer.
The [Max Pooling] operation with width and [stride] 2 helps to capture the most salient features extracted by the previous layer and reduces the output size from 145 to 72 vectors.
The Dropout operation with probability p = 0.5 is used to prevent [overfitting] during the [training phase].
We notice that the best architecture is the [CONV]-[LSTM]-FCX2.
We have proposed a novel [model parameter] training scheme based on the concepts of quantum computing.
We apply [deep learning methods] in this paper, namely we use [convolutional neural networks] ([CNNs]) for description and prediction of the red blood cells’ trajectory, which is crucial in modeling of a blood flow.
[Training and testing sets] used for [neural network] are extracted from simulations which differ only in initial [seeding] of the cells.
Besides using [convolution] or [fully connected layers], we also used a relatively new type of layers, the [dense convolution layers], introduced in.
Used [neural network] architecture [hyperparameters] are these: [Weights] are initialized in the range xavier, [bias] is set to 0. [Learning rate] is 0.0002, λ1 = λ2 = 0.000001, [dropout] = 0.02 and [minibatch] size is 32.
The [training phase] lasts about 6 hours for more complicated network architectures.
The [convolution region] of the [CNNs] includes the [convolution], the [activation] and the [pooling layers].
80% (400 Healthy and 400 Sick) were allocated to [training and testing], that is, the processes of extracting the attributes and optimizing the [weights] of the filters.
20% (100 thermographies in each class) were reserved for blind [validation] and establishing the final predictive [accuracy] of these architectures using a database of images that was not used for learning ([training and testing]).
Different techniques were used to improve the [accuracy]: [Learning rate] tuning, which controls the update of the [CNNs] weights.
This [parameter] greatly impacts the result and performance of the [CNN] model.
The [neural networks] are updated via the [stochastic gradient].
Data Augmentation, that consists in the realization of different random operations of rotation, translation and zoom on the images to avoid [overfitting] and improve [generalization].
It is applied using a “differential [learning rate]”, that is, introducing three different and successively higher values of the [learning rate], thus taking into account the differential knowledge of the layers.
Therefore, although [Resnet50] provided the highest [accuracy] is less stable than [Resnet 34] (1.09% vs 0.63%).
Table 2 provides the corresponding [confusion matrices] in [validation].
With respect to the tune of models’ [hyper-parameters], the R package mlrMBO was used to perform a Bayesian optimization within the [train set].
This package implements a Bayesian optimization of black-box functions which allows to find faster an optimal [hyper-parameters] setting in contrast to traditional [hyperparameters] search strategies such as [grid search] (highly time consuming when more than 3 [hyper-parameters] are tuned) or [random search] (not efficient enough since similar or non-sense [hyper-parameters] settings might be tested).
Table 1 shows the average [AUC] performance, standard deviation and number of genes retained by the different models tested over the test sets of the [cross-validation] setting.
The proposed [Convolutional Neural Network] ([CNN]) is consisting of two parallel [convolutional layers] taking as inputs transversal, coronal and axial slices acquired before and after chemotherapy for each patient.
As illustrated in Fig. 2, this architecture contains two similar branches, each one contains 4 blocks of [2D convolution] followed by an [activation function] ([ReLU]) and a [Max pooling] layer.
In the first and second blocks, 32 [kernels] were used for each [convolutional layer].
The parallel [Deep learning] architecture was applied for each view using corresponding slices before and after the first chemotherapy.
Consequently, we used the [Stochastic Gradient Descent] ([SGD]) with a [learning rate] of 0.0052.
A [learning rate] decay of 3.46e−5 was used to schedule a best [accuracy].
To compile the model, a categorical [cross entropy] was used as [loss function] and standard accuracy was used as a metric.
To avoid results’ [bias], a 5-Fold stratified [cross validation] with [AUC] as metric was used.
Within 150 [epochs] with 5-fold stratified [cross validation], an [accuracy] of 90.03 was obtained using 20% of 3D [validation data].
An [overfitting] was observed during training when using only one of the views without data augmentation.
Besides the work we did on building other types of agents we have also tried to explore in more depth different cognitive and affective models of agents, including symbolic BDI models as well as [neural network models].
While we are defining FSTs, and after having introduced the use of HMMs as stochastic FSTs, it is worth noticing that regular transduction rules can also be implemented in the form of so-called [multilayer perceptrons] ([MLP]) , a particular type of [artificial neural networks].
[Artificial neural networks] are based on simplistic models for biological neuron behavior and the interconnections between these neurons.
Most often, the nonlinear function is a limiter or a [sigmoid] function.
The [MLP] is the far most widely used network.
It is composed of an [input layer] and an [output layer] separated by one or more [hidden layers] of [nodes], with each layer connected to the next layer, feeding its [node] values forward (Fig. 2.4).
In many domains, [neural networks] are an effective alternative to statistical methods.
James Henderson has identified a suitable [neural network] architecture for natural language parsing, called [Simple Synchrony Networks] ([SSNs]), which he discusses in chapter 6, A [Neural Network] Parser that Handles Sparse Data.
Because [neural networks] learn their own internal representations‚ [neural networks] can decide automatically what features to count and how reliable they are for estimating the desired probabilities.
This [generalization] ability is a result of using a [neural network] method for representing sets of objects‚ called Temporal Synchrony Variable Binding (TSVB) (Shastri and Ajjanagadde‚ 1993).
[SRNs] can learn [generalizations] over positions in an input sequence (and thus can handle unbounded input sequences)‚ which has made them of interest in natural language processing.
By using TSVB to represent the constituents in a syntactic structure‚ [SSNs] also learn [generalizations] over structural constituents.
The linguistic relevance of this class of [generalizations] is what accounts for the fact that [SSNs] generalize from [training set] to [testing set] in an appropriate way‚ as demonstrated in Section 4.
In this section we briefly outline the [SSN] architecture and how it can be used to estimate the [parameters] of a probability model.
Standard pattern-recognition [neural networks] such as [Multi-Layered Perceptrons] ([MLPs]) take a vector of real values as input‚ compute hidden internal representation which is also a vector of real values‚ and output a third vector of real values.
[Simple Recurrent Networks] extend [MLPs] to sequences by using the hidden representations as representations of the network’s state at a given point in the sequence.
[Simple Synchrony Networks] extend [SRNs] by computing one of these sequences for each object in a set of objects.
The most important feature of any learning architecture is how it [generalizes] from [training data] to [testing data].
[SRNs] are popular for sequence processing because they inherently generalize over sequence positions.
Because inputs are fed to an [SRN] one at a time‚ and the same trained [parameters] (called link weights) apply at every time‚ information learned at one sequence position will inherently be generalized to other sequence positions.
This [generalization] ability manifests itself in the fact that [SRNs] can handle arbitrarily long sequences.
This [generalization] ability manifests itself in the fact that these networks can handle arbitrarily many constituents‚ and therefore unbounded phrase structure trees.
After the parent of a terminal is chosen it is used by the [SSN] to estimate the parameters for latter portions of the sentence‚ including latter parent estimates.
We also [bias] the [network training] by providing a new-nonterminal input unit.
To test the ability of [Simple Synchrony Networks] to handle sparse data we train the [SSN] parser described in the previous section on a relatively small set of sentences and then test how well it generalizes to a set of previously unseen sentences.
This process can be continued until no more changes are made, but to avoid [over-fitting] it is better to check the performance of the network on a [validation set] and stop training when the performance on the [validation set] reaches a maximum.
This is why we have split the corpus into three datasets, one for [training], one for [validation], and one for [testing].
This technique also allows multiple versions of the network to be trained and then evaluated using the [validation set], without ever using the [testing set] until a single network has been chosen.
A variety of [hidden layer] sizes and random initial [weight seeds] were used in the different networks.
Larger [hidden layers] result in the network being able to [fit the training data] more precisely, but can lead to [over-fitting] and therefore bad performance on the [validation set].
From the multiple networks trained, the best network was chosen on the basis of its performance on the [validation set], and this one network was used in testing.
The best network had 100 [hidden units] and trained for a total of 145 passes through the [training set].
Because this process does not require a [validation set], we estimate these [parameters] using the combination of the [training set] and the [validation set].
This [generalization] performance is due to [SSNs’] ability to generalize across constituents as well as across sequence positions, plus the ability of [neural networks] in general to learn what input features are important as well as what they imply about the output.
In particular, we used a [momentum] of 0.9 and [weight decay] [regularization] of between 0.1 and 0.0. Both the [learning rate] and the [weight decay] were decreased as the learning proceeded, based on [training error] and [validation error], respectively.
We mean feature here in the sense of features which can be computed from discourse as input to [machine learning] algorithms for classification tasks such as topic segmentation.
Moreover, generic tools are provided for iterating over discourses, processing them, and extracting sets of feature values at regular intervals which can then be piped directly into learners like decision trees, [neural nets] or support vector machines
We have found the visualiser to be invaluable in debugging algorithms for feature extractors, tweaking [parameter] values, and hypothesizing new, interesting features.
A variety of [learning parameters] were explored, and the best-performing [parameter] set was selected: initial Q values set to 0, exploration parameter ε = 0.2, and the [learning rate] α set to 1/k (where k is the number of visits to the Q(s, a) being updated).
Schmid (1994a) presents a [neural network] tagger based on [multilayer perceptron networks].
An [artificial neural network] consist of simple units (each associated with an activation value) and directed links for passing the values between the units.
[Activation values] are propagated from input to [output layers].
At each unit, the [input activation values] are summed and a [bias] parameter is added.
The network learns by adapting the [weights] of the connections between units until the correct output is produced.
In the [output layer], all units have a value of zero except the correct unit (tag), which gets the value of one.
In a system of this kind, tagging a word means (i) copying the tag probabilities of the word and its neighbours into the [input units] and (ii) propagating the activations to the [output units].
We will first discuss the acquisition of tagging rules using [supervised learning], where a manually tagged corpus is available to be used as a 'gold standard' to guide learning.
In [back-propagation] learning, this training is done by repeatedly iterating over all examples, comparing for each example the output predicted by the network (random at first) to the desired output and changing [connection weights] between network nodes in such a way that performance increases.
[Multilayer Perceptrons] (Rumelhart et al. 1986) are the most popular [neural network] architecture.
The [activation rule] is a local rule which is used by each unit to compute its activation.
Given two words preceding context and 89 categories, the network has an [input layer] of 178 units and an [output layer] of 89 units.
Adding a [hidden layer] to a two-layer network did not improve performance.
Connectionist approaches also require the computation of fewer [parameters] ([weights]) than statistical models (N-gram probabilities), which becomes especially useful when considering a wider context than trigrams.
On the theoretical side, there is a need for more insight into the differences and similarities in how [generalization] is achieved in this area by different statistical and [machine learning] techniques.
Most emphasis in current [deep learning] [artificial neural network] based automatic recognition of speech is put on [deep net] architectures with multiple sequential levels of processing.
Current state-of-the-art stochastic ASR systems often estimate the likelihood p(X|W) by a discriminatively-trained [multi-layer perceptron] [artificial neural network] ([MLP]).
The rule-based algorithm obtained 60.67% splitting [accuracy] at word level and 94.31% [accuracy], within the word, at split level.
The [hyperparameters] found to optimize it are n = 4, α = 10−5, marker=true.
Recently there has been a renewed interest in applying [neural networks] ([ANNs]) to speech recognition, thanks to the invention of [deep neural nets].
It treats the network as a [deep belief network] ([DBN]) built out of [restricted Bolztmann machines] ([RBMs]), and optimizes an energy-based target function using the contrastive divergence (CD) algorithm.
As for the third method, it is different from the two above in the sense that in this case it is not the [training algorithm] that is slightly modified, but the neurons themselves.
Namely, the usual [sigmoid activation function] is replaced with the [rectifier function] max(0, x).
These kinds of [neural units] have been proposed by Glorot et al., and were successfully applied to image recognition and NLP tasks.
[Rectified linear units] were also found to improve [restricted Boltzmann machines].
It has been shown recently that a [deep rectifier network] can attain the same phone recognition performance as that for the [pre-trained nets] of Mohamed et al. [4], but without the need for any [pre-training].
This efficient unsupervised algorithm, first described in, can be used for learning the [connection weights] of a [deep belief network] ([DBN]) consisting of several layers of [restricted Boltzmann machines] ([RBMs]).
As their name implies, [RBM]s are a variant of [Boltzmann machines], with the restriction that their neurons must form a bipartite graph.
They have an [input layer], representing the features of the given task, a [hidden layer] which has to learn some representation of the input, and each connection in an [RBM] must be between a [visible unit] and a [hidden unit].
[RBMs] can be trained using the [one-step contrastive divergence] ([CD]) algorithm described in 6.
It is a simple algorithm where first we train a network with one [hidden layer] to [full convergence] using [backpropagation].
Then we replace the [softmax] layer by another randomly initialized [hidden layer] and a new [softmax] layer on top, and we train the network again.
This process is repeated until we reach the desired number of [hidden layers].
Seide et al. found that this method gives the best results if one performs only a few iterations of [backpropagation] in the [pre-training] phase (instead of training to full [convergence]) with an unusually large [learn rate].
In their paper, they concluded that this simple training strategy performs just as well as the much more complicated [DBN] [pre-training] method described above.
In the case of the third method it is not the [training algorithm], but the neurons that are slightly modified.
Instead of the usual [sigmoid activation], here we apply the [rectifier function max](0, x) for all [hidden neurons].
There are two fundamental differences between the [sigmoid] and the [rectifier functions].
One is that the output of [rectifier neurons] does not saturate as their activity gets higher.
Glorot et al. conjecture that this is very important in explaining their good performance in [deep nets]: because of this linearity, there is no [gradient vanishing] effect.
One might suppose that this could harm optimization by blocking [gradient backpropagation], but the experimental results do not support this hypothesis.
It seems that the hard nonlinearities do no harm as long as the gradient can propagate along some paths.
The main advantage of [deep rectifier nets] is that they can be trained with the standard [backpropagation] algorithm, without any [pre-training].
A random 10% of the [training set] was held out for [validation] purposes, and this block of data will be referred to as the ’[development set]’.
It contains about 28 hours of recordings, from which 22 hours were selected for the training set, 2 hours for the development set and 4 hours for the test set.
In the case of the DBN-based [pre-training] method (see Section 2.1), we applied [stochastic gradient descent] (i.e. [backpropagation]) training with a [mini-batch] size of 128.
For Gaussian-binary [RBMs], we ran 50 [epochs] with a fixed [learning rate] of 0.002, while for binary-binary [RBMs] we used 30 [epochs] with a [learning rate] of 0.02.
Then, to fine-tune the [pre-trained] nets, again [backpropagation] was applied with the same [mini-batch] size as that used for [pre-training].
The initial [learn rate] was set to 0.01, and it was halved after each [epoch] when the error on the [development set] increased.
During both the [pretraining] and fine-tuning phases, the learning was accelerated by using a [momentum] of 0.9 (except for the first [epoch] of fine-tuning, which did not use the [momentum] method).
Turning to the discriminative [pre-training] method (see Section 2.2), the initial [learn rate] was set to 0.01, and it was halved after each [epoch] when the error on the [development set] increased.
The [learn rate] was restored to its initial value of 0.01 after the addition of each layer.
Furthermore, we found that using 5 [epochs] of [backpropagation] after the introduction of each layer gave the best results.
For both the pre-training and fine-tuning phases we used a [batch size] of 128 and [momentum] of 0.8 (except for the first [epoch]).
The initial [learn rate] for the fine-tuning of the full network was again set to 0.01.
The training of [deep rectifier nets] (see Section 2.3) did not require any pre-training at all.
The training of the network was performed using [backpropagation] with an initial [learn rate] of 0.001 and a [batch size] of 128.
As can be seen, the three training methods performed very similarly on the test set, the only exception being the case of five [hidden layers], where the [rectifier net] performed slightly better.
It also significantly outperformed the other two methods on the [development set].
We mention that a single [hidden layer] net with the same amount of [weights] as the best [deep net] yielded 23.7%.
Similar to the TIMIT tests, 2048 neurons were used for each [hidden layer], with a varying number of [hidden layers].
The error rates seem to saturate at 4-5 [hidden layers], and the curves for the three methods run parallel and have only slightly different values.
The lowest error rate is attained with the five-layer [rectifier network], both on the development and the [test sets].
The iteration count we applied here (50 for Gaussian [RBMs] and 30 for binary [RBMs]) is an average value, and follows the work of Seide et al.
Discriminative pre-training is also much faster than the DBN-based method, but is still slower than [rectifier nets].
[Tuning the parameters] so that the two systems had a similar real-time factor was also out of the question, as the hybrid model was implemented on a GPU, while the HMM used a normal CPU.
Here, we compared two training methods and a new type of [activation function] for [deep neural nets], and evaluated them on a large vocabulary recognition task.
The three algorithms yielded quite similar recognition performances, but based on the training times [deep rectifier networks] seem to be the preferred choice.
While the resulting speech sound likelihood estimates are demonstrated to be better that the earlier used likelihoods derived by generative Gaussian Mixture Models, unexpected signal distortions that were not seen in the [training data] can still make the acoustic likelihoods unacceptably low.
Here, we compare three methods; namely, the unsupervised pre-training algorithm of Hinton et al., a [supervised pre-training] method that constructs the network layer-by-layer, and [deep rectifier networks], which differ from standard nets in their [activation function].
Overall, for the large vocabulary speech recognition task we study here, [deep rectifier networks] offer the best tradeoff between accuracy and [training time].
In this new proposed approach, a [multi-layer neural network] ([multi-layer perceptron]) is used to learn the [decision function] that will then be used to select the words.
For training the [neural network parameters] we have to associate a target value to each word.
The scores produced by the [neural network] module will then be used to sort the list of candidate words, and the top of the list will be selected to define the recognition vocabulary.
Feature vectors and associated target values are used for training the [neural network]: the input-feature vector is the [input layer] (36 [input neurons]); the target value is the output of the unique [output layer neuron].
There is one [hidden layer] containing 18 neurons.
In recent years [feed forward neural networks] ([FFNN])  attracted attention due their ability to overcome biggest disadvantage of n-gram models: even when the ngram is not observed in training, FFNN estimates probabilities of the word based on the full history.
The [RNN] is going further in model [generalization]: instead of considering only the several previous words (parameter n) the [recursive weights] are assumed to represent short term memory.
[Long Short-Term Memory] ([LSTM]) [neural network] is different type of [RNN] structure.
[LSTM] approved themselves in various applications and it seems to be very promising course also for the field of language modelling.
Typical [NN] unit consists of the [input activation] which is transformed to [output activation] with [activation function] (usually [sigmoidal]).
Firstly, the [activation function] is applied to all gates.
There is a [softmax function] used in [output layer] to produce normalized probabilities.
Normalization of input vector which is generally advised for [neural networks] is not needed due the 1-of-N input coding.
All models were trained with 20 cells in [hidden layer].
The [recurrent neural network] language model RNNLM, originally proposed by 2 and 3, incorporates the time dimension by expanding the [input layer], which represents the current input word, with the previous [hidden layer].
Theoretically, [recurrent neural networks] can store relevant information from previous time steps for an arbitrarily long period of time, making it possible to learn long-term dependencies.
To explain how our approach works, let us examine the operation of a simple [perceptron] model.
Hence, if the [weights] of the [feature extraction layer] were initialized with 2D DCT or Gabor filter coefficients, and only the weights of the hidden and [output layers] were tuned during training, then the model would be equivalent to a more traditional system, and incorporating the feature extraction step into the system would be just an implementational detail.
Usually, as the [backpropagation] algorithm guarantees only a locally optimal solution, initializing the model with weights that already provide a good solution may help the [backpropagation] algorithm find a better local optimum than the one found using random initial values.
We should add that the same [weights] are applied on each input block, so the number of [weights] will not change in this layer.
It consisted of a hidden [feature extraction layer] with a [linear activation function], a [hidden layer] (with 1000 neurons) with the [sigmoid activation function], and an [output layer] containing [softmax units].
The number of [output neurons] was set to the number of classes (39), while the number of neurons in the input and [feature extraction layers] varied, depending on how many neighbouring patches were actually used.
The [neural net] was trained with [random initial weights] in the hidden and [output layers], using standard [backpropagation] on 90% of the [training data] in [semi-batch] mode, while [crossvalidation] on the remaining, randomly selected 10% of the [training set] was used as the stopping criterion.
The ‘extreme learning machine’ of Huang et al. also exploits this suprising fact: this learning model is practically a [twolayer network], where both layers are initialized randomly, and the lowest layer is not trained at all.
In order to verify how the whisper can be recognized by the [ANN], the two speakerdependent ASRs were developed with MATLAB [Neural Network] Toolbox.
The structures of these [ANNs] were: 396 [input nodes], 140 [hidden neurons] and 50 [output neurons].
For each speaker all words are divided into three parts: 60% of them are used for training, 20% for [validation] and 20% for testing.
The training, [development and test sets] for the classification task were not selected from the corpus in a completely random manner, but instead the division respected the websites, i.e. one set of websites was denoted the training set, another – [development set] and the third – [test set].
The ASR system uses a hybrid Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and [Deep Neural Network] (DNN) architecture and a general 550k lexicon.
The [DNN] utilizes five [hidden layers], with 1,024 [neurons per layer], and a [learning rate] of 0.08.
The [ReLU] function is used as the [activation function] of neurons.
This [DNN] is trained for 35 [epochs] using 300 h of speech recordings.
Recently, [neural-network] based approaches, in which words are “embedded” into a low-dimensional space, appeared and became to be used in lexical semantic tasks.
Following recent advances in [artificial neural network] research, the recognizer employs [parametric rectified linear units] ([PReLU]), word embeddings and character-level embeddings based on [gated linear units] ([GRU]).
[LSTMs] are specially shaped units of [artificial neural networks] designed to process whole sequences.
Recently, a [gated linear unit] ([GRU]) was proposed by Sam as an alternative to [LSTM], and was shown to have similar performance, while being less computationally demanding.
Instead [regularized averaged perceptron], we use [parametric rectified linear units], character-level embeddings and [dropout].
The [input layer] is connected to a [hidden layer] of [parametric rectified linear units] and the [hidden layer] is connected to the [output layer] which is a [softmax layer] producing probability distribution for all possible named entity classes in BILOU encoding.
The network is trained with [AdaGrad] and we use [dropou]t on the [hidden layer].
We implemented our [neural network] in Torch7, a scientific computing framework with wide support for machine learning algorithms.
We tuned most of the [hyperparameters] on development portion of CNEC 1.0 and used them for all other corpora.
Notably, we utilize window size W = 2, [hidden layer] of 200 nodes, [dropout] 0.5, [minibatches] of size 100 and [learning rate] 0.02 with decay.
All reported experiments use an ensemble of 5 networks, each using different [random seed], with the resulting distributions being an average of individual networks distributions.
A work most similar to ours, also proposed [neural network] architecture with word embeddings and character-level embeddings.
The best published WER on CMUDict at present is demonstrated in using [Long Short-term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks] ([LSTM]) combined with a 5-gram graphone language model.
We also use the exact same split of 90 % [training data] and 10 % [test data] as in 9, and thus our results are directly comparable to theirs.
Hierarchical [softmax] and related procedures that involve decomposing the [output layer] into classes can help with this normalization.
We found that 15 classes optimized perplexity values for [RNNLMs] with 50 and 145 [hidden nodes], and 18 classes optimized perplexity values for [RNNLMs] with 500 nodes.
The [learning rate] (η) adaptation scheme is managed by the [adaptive gradient] methods.
After optimizing on the [development set], η was fixed to 0.1 and the dimensionality of the latent space C was fixed at 45.
An [RNNLM] with 145 [hidden nodes] has about the same number of parameters as CDLM and performs 0.1 perplexity points worse than CDLM.
Increasing the [hidden units] for [RNNLM] to 500, we obtain the best performing [RNNLM].
To produce better performing LMs with fewer parameters we constructed an [RNNLM] with 50 hidden units, which when linearly combined with CDLM (CDLM+RNNLM ) outperforms the best [RNNLM] using less than half as many parameters.
The architecture for this kind of feature extraction consists of two [NNs] trained towards phonetic targets.
The first-stage [NN] has four [hidden layers] with 1500 units each except the BN layer.
BN layer’s size is 80 neurons and it is the third [hidden layer].
Linear regression is used on all single systems for arousal and all single systems for valence except for processing video geometric features, where [neural network] with one [hidden laye]r is used (topology: 948–474–3).
We trained a [neural network] with one [hidden layer] with topology 945–474–3 in this case.
Our approach uses a [bidirectional recurrent neural network] ([BRNN]) since speech has the form of a sequential signal with complex dependencies between the different time steps in both directions.
Additionally we propose an alternative layout for the [BRNN] and show that it performs better on that specific task.
Usage of [deep bidirectional GRU] layers can be found in the work of Amodei et al. where, for example, up to seven [bidirectional GRU] layers are used and even combined with up to three [convolutional layers] which altogether improved the performance of the network.
An approach for speech classification solely using [Convolutional Neural Networks] ([CNN]) instead of recurrent ones can be seen in the work of Milde and Biemann.
[GRU Networks] are a variation of the [long short term memory] ([LSTM]) networks.
Conventional [RNN] structures propagate information only forwards in time.
In this context, [bidirectional RNNs] can be helpful by having separate layers processing the two different directions and feeding each others output into the same output layer as it is depicted in Fig.
Here, the output of the [forward layer] is not directly propagated towards the [output layer], instead it serves as the input of the [backward layer].
[Deep neural networks] usually come with a large amount of parameters, leaving them prone to [overfitting].
One straightforward way of avoiding that is using [Dropout].
Those are applied by multiplying the output of each node that propagates towards a [dropout layer] by some random noise with each [batch of training data].
The amount of deactivated nodes depends on the [dropout rate] p which can be seen as the distribution’s parameter in the binary case.
The positive effect of better [generalization] capabilities can be explained in two ways.
First, it essentially produces an [ensemble of neural networks] and therefore producing an equally averaged result over those.
We use the training, test and [development-test sets] which have originally been provided in the challenge.
The [RNNs] are built in Python using the Keras framework.
We use two [GRU] layers with 128 [hidden states] each.
For the merged [BRNN] those are both connected to the input and combine their results to a [dropout layer] with p = 0.4.
For the [sequential BRNN] the first [GRU layer] produces another time-dependent sequence which is then fed into the [backward GRU layer].
After each of those follows one layer of [dropout] with p = 0.4.
For both types of networks we finally use one to three [fully connected (dense)] layers with, again, 128 [hidden states] each, eventually followed by another single-state layer which produces the output by applying the [sigmoid function] which is also used as the inner activation of the [GRU nodes].
The remaining [activation functions] between each two nodes are defined as the rectifier or [relu function].
As optimizer we use [Adam]. In earlier stages, RMSprop has also been tried, but it clearly proved to perform worse on that learning task and also oscillated a lot, making it useless for the [early stopping] described in Sect. 4.4.
The loss which is minimized in the training stage is the [binary cross-entropy].
The model is then trained for a maximum of 50 [epochs] and evaluated on the remaining 900 samples of the [development-test set] after each iteration.
Training is stopped when the UAR of the [validation set] does not increase for 10 [epochs].
A model checkpoint is used to keep track of the [weights] which have been used to reach the highest [UAR] on the [validation set] up to the last [epoch].
Finally we obtain a measure of general performance by using the highest scoring model to predict the labels on the [testing set].
Also, the [Gaussian dropout] leads to slightly higher performance than the binary one.
In most cases the network with two [fully connected layers] after the recurrent ones achieves the highest measures.
Eventually we used the [sequential BRNN] with two [dense layers] and [Gaussian dropout] after being trained on the sets specified in Sect. 4.4 to predict the labels of the [testing set] and reached a [UAR] of 71.03 and an accuracy of 71.30 percent.
Also it became clear, that there exists a variant of [BRNNs] which has, to our knowledge, not been researched thoroughly yet.
The topic of the paper is the training of [deep neural networks] which use tunable [piecewise-linear activation functions] called “[maxout]” for speech recognition tasks.
[Maxout networks] are compared to the conventional [fully-connected DNNs] in case of training with both [crossentropy] and [sequence discriminative] (sMBR) criteria.
The clear advantage of [maxout networks] over [DNNs] is demonstrated when using the [cross-entropy] criterion on both corpora.
It is also argued that [maxout networks] are prone to [overfitting] during sequence training but in some cases it can be successfully overcome with the use of the KL-divergence based [regularization].
The [greedy layerwise pretraining] method became an impulse for tempestuous development of [DNN] training.
The pretraining results in [DNN] [weights] initialization that facilitates the subsequent finetuning and improves its quality.
Nevertheless, the [fully connected feedforward deep neural networks] (hereinafter just [DNNs] for brevity) still remain the workhorses of the large majority of ASR systems.
The introduction of [piecewise-linear ReLU] ([rectified linear units]) [activation functions] made it possible to simplify and improve the optimization process during [DNN] training significantly.
It was shown that [DNNs] with [ReLU] activations may be successfully learned without [layerwise pretraining].
However, the fact that [ReLU] and its analogues are linear almost everywhere may also result in [overfitting] and instability of the training process.
This implies the necessity of using effective [regularization] techniques.
[Dropout] can be treated as an approximate way to learn the exponentially large ensemble of different [neural nets] with subsequent averaging.
To improve efficiency of the [dropout regularization] a new sort of tunable [piecewise-linear activation function] called [maxout] was proposed in 9.
In a short time the [deep maxout networks] ([DMN]) were applied to speech recognition tasks.
It was also shown that [dropout] for [DMNs] can be very effective in an annealed mode, i.e. if the [dropout rate] gradually decreases [epoch-by-epoch].
We apply [DMNs] to two significantly different tasks and demonstrate their clear superiority over conventional [DNNs] under [cross-entropy] ([CE]) training.
[Dropout] proposed in is a [regularization technique] for [deep feedforward network] training which is effective in particular for training network with a large amount of parameters on a limited size dataset.
In the original form of [dropout] it was proposed to randomly “turn off” half of neurons per every training example.
When the neurons with [piecewise-linear activation] functions (like [ReLU](x) = max(0, x)) are used the input space is divided into multiple regions where data is linearly transformed by the network.
From this point of view using of [dropout] with [piecewise-linear activation] functions performs the more exact ensemble averaging than with [activation functions] of nonzero curvature (such as [sigmoid]).
The effectiveness of [DNN]s with [ReLU] neurons trained with [dropout] was demonstrated on many tasks from different domains.
[Maxout] is a [piecewise-linear activation] function which was proposed to improve [neural network] training with [dropout].
The advantage of the [maxout activation function] over [ReLU] is the possibility to adjust its form by means of [parameters tuning] (although it comes at the cost of [k-fold] increasing of the parameters number).
[Maxout networks] (both fully-connected and [convolutional]) demonstrated impressive results on several benchmark tasks from the computer vision domain.
The first application of [Deep Maxout Networks] ([DMN]) to speech recognition task seems to be done in February and in March, where it was shown that training of [DMNs] can be effective even without using [dropout].
Nevertheless, the training of [DMNs] can be successfully combined with [dropout regularization] as it was shown here.
There it was proposed to use not the conventional [dropout] where the [dropout rate] is constant during the entire training but the [annealed dropout] (AD) which consists of the gradually decreasing [dropout rate] according to the linear schedule.
We do not compare [Maxout] + AD to [ReLU] + AD because, in our experience, AD training of [ReLU] networks does not provide significant WER reduction (it is also observed in the previous paper) whilist carefully tuned [sigmoidal DNNs] with [L2 weight decay] often outperform [ReLU DNNs] with [dropout] and other types of regularization.
When the model was trained the low-rank factorization (based on SVD) of the last [hidden layer] was performed and the model was fine-tuned to provide bottleneck features, hereinafter SDBNs (Speaker-Dependent BottleNeck).
In our first attempts we did not use [regularization].
Since we observed that the [cross-validation] value of the sMBR criterion either increases or remains constant [epoch-by-epoch] we concluded that the model is [overfit].
So to improve ST performance an effective [regularization] is required.
We tried to use the [L1] and [L2] penalty as well as [dropou]t and F-smoothing to make ST work on Switchboard, however none of these approaches succeeded in [overfitting] reduction.
We considered the use of [maxout activation functions] for training [deep neural networks] as acoustic models for ASR.
Using two English speech corpora namely CHiME Challenge 2015 dataset and Switchboard we demonstrated that in case of training with the [cross-entropy] criterion [Deep Maxout Networks] ([DMN]) are superior to conventional fully-connected [feedforward sigmoidal DNNs].
For the same [layer sizes] the number of [DMN] parameters is larger than that of [DNN] but the increase in [DNN layer sizes] is unable to provide the comparable accuracy gain.
We also found that sequence discriminative training of [maxout networks] is prone to [overfitting] which can be reduced with the use of KLD-[regularization].
The performance of the developed models was examined in terms of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) derived from the [ROC curves] as well as Pearson coefficient R between the predicted and the actual efficacy.
[Associative Neural Networks] ([ASNN]) approach and fragment descriptors were used to build the models.
In three layers neural networks, each neuron in the [initial layer] corresponded to one molecular descriptor.
[Hidden layer] contained from three to six neurons, whereas the [output layer] contained one (for STL and FN) or 11 (MTL) neurons, corresponding to the number of simultaneously treated properties.
Each model was validated using external [fivefold cross-validation] procedure.
Supervised learning is usually achieved in what are called [feed-forward NNs] that process data in several layers consisting of varying numbers of nodes.
These nodes are organized as [input nodes], several layers of [hidden nodes], and [output nodes].
A sliding window covers 60 nucleotides, which is calculated to 240 [input units] to the [neural network].
The [neural network] structure is a standard three layer [feedforward neural network].
This kind of [neural network] has several names, such as [multilayer perceptrons] ([MLP]), [feed forward neural network], and [backpropagation] [neural network].
There are two [output units] corresponding to the donor and acceptor splice sites, 128 [hidden layer] units and 240 [input units].
The 240 [input units] were used since the orthogonal input scheme uses four inputs each nucleotide in the window.
The [neural network] program code was reused from a previous study, and in this code the number of [hidden units] was hard coded and optimized for 128 [hidden units].
There is also a [bias] signal added to the [hidden layer] and the [output layer].
The [activation function] is a standard [sigmoid] function, shown in Eq. 1.
The β values for the [sigmoid functions] are 0.1 for both the [hidden layer] activation and the [output layer] activation.
When doing forward calculations and [backpropagation], the [sigmoid] function is called repetitively.
A fast and effective evaluation of the [sigmoid] function can improve the overall performance considerably.
To improve the performance of the [sigmoid] function, a precalculated table for the exponential function is used.
There is no [momentum] used in the training.
We have not implemented any second order methods to help the [convergence] of the [weights].
The [neural network] training is done using standard [backpropagation].
The training was done in three sessions, and for each session we chose separate, but constant, [learning rates].
The [learning rate], η, was chosen to be 0.2, 0.1, and 0.02, respectively.
The shown indicators are computed using a [neural network] which has been trained for about 80 [epochs], with a [learning rate] of 0.2.
The best performing [neural network], achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.552.
The MGN works in this case as a discrete time cellular [neural network] and the training is based on [stochastic gradient descent] as described in the paper.
The training of a TPNN is based on a combination of [stochastic gradient descend] and [back propagation] with several improvements that make the training of the shared weights feasible and that were reported in detail in the context of training [CNNs] for pattern recognition.
In [stochastic gradient descent], the true gradient is approximated by the gradient of the [loss function] which is evaluated on a single training sample.
[Weight decay] is a [regularization] method that penalizes large [weights] in the network.
The [weight decay] penalty term causes the insignificant [weights] to converge to zero.
The [parameter] µ is controlling the [stepsize] of the [gradient descend].
The initial [step size] is already small (around µ = 0.01) and it is decreased after each training [epoch] with a constant factor.
This is necessary to achieve a slow [convergence] of the [weights].
A sweep through the whole data set is called one [epoch].
Up to 1000 [epochs] are necessary to train the TPNN in a typical experimental setup (20 amino acids in the alphabet, peptides of length 5 to 10, 30-50 training samples from measurements as a starting set).
The slow [convergence] of the error is a consequence of the relative small [stepsize] in the [gradient descent], but it is necessary in order to get overall [convergence] of the [weights].
It is well known, that [neural network ensembles] perform better in terms of [generalisation] than single models would do.
An ensemble of TPNNs consists of several single TPNN models that are trained on randomly chosen subsets of the [training data] and the training starts with random [weight initializations].
Two analytical models have been used to fit the data set to a prognostic index: a piecewise linear model Cox regression, also known as proportional hazards, and a flexible model consisting of Partial Logistic [Artificial Neural Networks] regularised with Automatic Relevance Determination (PLANN-ARD).
If these features are stored in a vector f = (f1,...,fh), and if we represent the i-th residue in the sequence as ri, then f is obtained as: where N (h) is a non-linear function, which we implement by a two-layered [feedforward Neural Network] with h non-linear [output units].
The number of free [parameters] in the overall [N1-NN] can be controlled by: the number of units in the [hidden layer] of the sequence-to-feature network N (h) (), N H f ; the number of [hidden units] in the feature-to-output network N (o)(), N H o ; the number of [hidden states] in the feature vector f, which is also the number of [output units] in the sequence-to-feature network, Nf .
Each training is conducted by 10 [fold-cross validation], i.e. 10 different sets of training runs are performed in which a different tenth of the overall set is reserved for testing.
The [training set] is used to learn the free [parameters] of the network by [gradient descent], while the [validation set] is used to choose model and [hyperparameters] ([network size] and architecture, i.e. N H f , Nf and N H o ).
For each different architecture we run three trainings, which differ only in the training vs. [validation split].
For each fold the three networks for the best architecture are ensemble averaged and evaluated on the corresponding [test set].
Training is performed by [gradient descent] on the error, which we model as the relative entropy between the target class and the output of the network.
The overall output of the network (output layer of N (o) ()) is implemented as a [softmax] function, while all internal squashing functions are implemented as [hyperbolic tangents].
Training terminates when either the walltime on the server is reached (6 days for fungi and plants, 10 days for animals) or the [epoch] limit is reached (40k for fungi and plants and 20k for animals).
The gradient is updated 360 times for each [epoch] (or once every 2-6 examples, depending on the set), and the examples are shuffled between [epochs.
The [learning rate] is halved every time a reduction of the error is not observed for more than 50 [epochs].
Both predictors are assessed by [ten-fold cross-validation].
The type of [neural network] with which we performed the experiments was [Multilayer Perceptron] ([MLP]), because the results obtained with other types of networks were not satisfactory and they tended to be slower than [MLP].
The preparatory steps for conducting the experiments consisted in determining: a) the size of the training and [testing set]; b) the [error function]; c) the number of [hidden units]; d) the [activation functions] for the hidden and the [output neurons]; e) the minimum and maximum values for [weight decay].
For the [hidden neuron]s were used as [activation functions] identity, logistic, [tanh] and exponential and the same ones were chosen for the [output neurons].
The [error functions] used were [sum of squares] and [cross entropy].
The minimum and the maximum number of [hidden units] were chosen differently for each experiment because we conducted several experiments which had different number of inputs.
The larger the number of [hidden units] in a [neural network] model the stronger the model is, the more capable the network is to model complex relationships between the inputs and the target variables.
The optimal number of [hidden units] is minimum 1/10 of the number of training cases and maximum 1/5, but we have varied this interval.
The use of [decay weights] for [hidden layer] and [output layer] was preferred in order to prevent [overfitting], thereby potentially improving [generalization] performance of the network.
[Weight decay] or [weight] elimination are often used in [MLP] training and aim to minimize a [cost function] which penalizes large [weights].
These techniques tend to result in networks with smaller [weights].
The minimum chosen [weight decay] was 0.0001 and the maximum 0.001.
To perform the experiments the data were split in a training (67 %) and a [testing dataset] (33 %).
As [error functions], we tested the [cross entropy] and the [sum of squares].
The [weight decays] in both the hidden and the [output layer] varied between 0.0001 and 0.001.
The values of the CV criterion (Table 1) show a better performance in correspondence to a choice of 6 [hidden units] and [decay parameter] equal to 0.01, that we therefore used.
[Ten-fold cross-validation] obtained by averaging over five fits for various values of the number of hidden units (H) and of the [decay parameter].

Additionally, one of the authors recently took advantage of a [deep learning] algorithm, built on a multilayer [autoencoder] [neural network], that lead to interesting prediction results in reference.
We use the July 2009 version of the datasets for analyzing and selecting [hyper-parameters].
[Autoencoder neural networks] were trained using the free GPU-accelerated software package Torch7 using [stochastic gradient descent] with a [learning rate] of 0.01 for 25 iterations.
[L2 regularization] was used on all [weights], which were initialized randomly from the uniform distribution.
The [hidden unit] function is a [Sigmoid].
The [neural network] is a modified version of [General Regression Neural Network] ([GRNN]) used as a classification tool.
In order to perform the barcode sequences classification, we introduce a modified version of [General Regression Neural Network] ([GRNN]) that use, alternatively, a function derived from Jaccard distance and fractional distance (instead of the euclidean one) to compare learned prototypes against test sequences.
The proposed method is based on two modified versions of the [General Regression Neural Network].
The [General Regression Neural Network] is a [neural network] created for regression i.e. the approximation of a dependent variable y given a set of sample (x, y), where x is the independent variable.
Classification results, in terms of [accuracy], [precision] and [recall] scores, have been compared with both the [GRNN] algorithm using J-function and the SVM classifier.
[Simple spiking neural network] models such as Integrate and fire models without bio-realistic features were simulated in the older generation GPUs.
All above described methods require to set two [hyper-parameters]: λ and α controlling the sparsity and the network influence, respectively.
[Deep learning neural networks] are capable to extract significant features from raw data, and to use these features for classification tasks.
In this work we present a [deep learning neural network] for DNA sequence classification based on spectral sequence representation.
The framework is tested on a dataset of 16S genes and its performances, in terms of [accuracy] and F1 score, are compared to the [General Regression Neural Network], already tested on a similar problem, as well as naive Bayes, random forest and support vector machine classifiers.
The obtained results demonstrate that the [deep learning approach] outperformed all the other classifiers when considering classification of small sequence fragment 500 bp long.
Among the [deep learning architecture], it is usually comprised the [LeNet-5] network, or [Convolutional Neural Network] ([CNN]), a [neural network] that is inspired by the visual system’s structure.
In this work we want to understand if the [convolutional network] is capable to identify and to use these features for sequence classification, outperforming the classifiers proposed in the past.
The one used in this work is a modified version of the [LeNet-5] network introduced by LeCun et al. in and it is implemented using the python Theano package for [deep learning].
The modified [LeNet-5] proposed network is made of two lower layers of [convolutional] and [max-pooling] processing elements, followed by two “traditional” fully connected [Multi Layer Perceptron] ([MLP]) processing layers, so that there are 6 processing layers.
The [max-pooling] is a non-linear [down-sampling layer].
The first layer of [convolutional kernels], named kernel 0, is made of L = 10 kernels of dimension 5 (so that n = 2).
From a spectral representation vector made of 1024 components this layer produces 10 vectors of 1024 dimensions that the [pooling layer] reduces to the 10 feature maps of 510 dimensions.
These vectors are the input for the second [convolutional layer].
The second [layer of kernel] (kernel 1 ) is made of L = 20 kernels of dimension 5.
In both cases the [max-pooling] layer has dimension 2.
[Convolution] and [maxpooling] are usually considered together and they are represented in the lower part of Fig. 2 as two highly connected blocks.
The two upper level layers corresponds to a traditional fully-connected [MLP]: the first layer of the [MLP] operates on the total number of output from the lower level (the output is flattened to a 1-D vector) and the total number of units in the [Hidden Layer] is 500.
In the second case, the ten-fold [cross validation] scheme was repeated considering as test set the sequence fragments of shorter size, 500 bp long, obtained randomly extracting 500 consecutive nucleotides from the original full length sequences.
The [CNN] 134 has been run considering two different kernels sizes: kernel 0 = kernel 1 = 5 in the first run; kernel 0 = 25, kernel 1 = 15 in the second run.
In both configurations the [training phase] has been run for 200 [epochs].
The spectral representation is obtained as k-mers frequencies along the sequences; the [CNN] belongs to the so called “[deep learning]” algorithms.
We designed and tested some topic modeling techniques, and we took advantage of a [deep neural network] approach.
A [convolutional neural net] learns to classify patches as salient (long looks) or not.
Two [output neurons] were connected to the reinitialized layer, then training followed on augmented 800 × 800 px patches for 10,000 iterations in Caffe.
Arguments of rkhs$new(.) define initial values of the functions and the initial value of the [l 2 norm weighting parameter].
